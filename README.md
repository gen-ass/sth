# STH
Site created for a hospitality department at a University to be mobile only focused and cater for a special niche of users that access the main site using mobile devices. A further requirement was that the client wanted a desktop view and the ability to return from the desktop view back to the mobile view to the same place. This was achieved using a cookie that kept track of the user position on page on their mobile device.

## What was used
underlying languages used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Who was involved
Design, development of site was done by me in collaboration with client (marketing manager). Testing, server setup was initialised by me. 

## Continued support
During the production lifetime of the site I was responsible for maintenance and adherence to the University branding that was incorporated into the site. It was also my responsibility to setup a newsletter campaign, the newsletter was custom built and used and online distribution software to send out the campaign.
